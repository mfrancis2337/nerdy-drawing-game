			<p>You have arrived at the infamous error 404: you tried to access a page that doesn't exist. But don't worry, everyone makes mistakes. As to why you were trying to access a page that doesn't exist is beyond me, seeing as there is only one page that is supposed to be visited. But that doesn't matter.</p>
			<p>If you would like to return to the page, you can visit <a href="index.html">this link</a>. Have a nice day!</p>
